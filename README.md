## Description:
JobFinder is an app designed to eliminate job seekers from having to filter through multiple large databases/websites to find jobs specific to their career fields and curtail it to their local area and career field preferences.

This backend group project was part of a 1-week sprint using Node.js and Express.

## Main Features:
- Register/login users - managed by a Postgres Database
- "Jobs" tab shows recent developer job listings in descending order.
  - Each listing has a direct link to the indeed job posting url.
- "Search" tab allows users to find jobs through a set of input fields: job title/keyword and location, both of which are required, and through additional optional parameters: results by page and distance from location.
